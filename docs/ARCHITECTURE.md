# Architecture

How the Pip-Boy 3000 watch face is put together and how it runs on the Amazfit Balance 2
(ZeppOS, 480×480 round display).

## Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `app.json` | Zeus manifest. `configVersion: v3`, `appType: "watchface"`, unique `appId`, target API **`4.0.0`**, and a `targets.balance2` block with the three Balance 2 platforms (`Lyon`/`LyonWN`/`LyonW`, deviceSource 9568512/13/15), `designWidth: 480`, and `module.watchface.path = "watchface/index"`. `icon`/`cover` point at `Preview.png`. At build time Zeus flattens `targets.balance2` into the top-level `module`/`platforms` form in the device package. |
| `app.js` | Modern `App({...})` entry (lifecycle stubs). Not watch-face-specific. |
| `watchface/index.js` | The whole watch face, as **modern ZeppOS `@zos` source**: a `WatchFace({ build(), onResume(), onPause(), updateGauges(), updateDate(), onDestroy() })`. The only file with real logic. |
| `preview.js` | Local static renderer (Node, zero deps) — composites the face to a PNG/GIF (no watch needed). See [Preview](#preview). |
| `assets/balance2/` | All images (numbered PNGs + the cover `Preview.png`) and the font, under the per-target subfolder. See [ASSETS.md](ASSETS.md). |
| `package.json` / `jsconfig.json` | Dev tooling: npm scripts (`build`/`dev`/`preview`/`lint`/`format`) and editor type hints via the `@zeppos/device-types` devDependency. Not needed to build (Zeus resolves `@zos/*` itself); `npm install` only for IntelliSense/lint. |
| `.eslintrc.json` / `.prettierrc.json` / `.editorconfig` | Lint/format/editor consistency. |

**Build:** `zeus build` bundles the `@zos` source (ROLLUP), compiles it to QuickJS bytecode
(`index.bin`), converts the PNGs to native ZeppOS TGA, and packs a `.zab`/`.zpk` into `dist/`.
Zeus wraps the source in its own runtime bootstrap. (An earlier build fed Zeus the
*editor-exported, pre-wrapped* form and declared API 3.0 → black screen on device; the fix was
re-authoring as `@zos` source — see finding #11 in [ZEPPOS-FINDINGS.md](ZEPPOS-FINDINGS.md).)

## Runtime lifecycle

`watchface/index.js` is a modern `@zos` module:

```js
WatchFace({
  build()        { /* create every widget (incl. the firmware-driven Vault Boy IMG_ANIM); register sensor onChange + a WIDGET_DELEGATE; onResume() */ },
  onResume()     { /* (re)start the refresh timer */ },
  onPause()      { /* stop the timers while the face is hidden (battery) */ },
  updateGauges() { /* set each gauge IMG's src from its sensor fraction */ },
  updateDate()   { /* refresh the per-digit date from the Time sensor */ },
  onDestroy()    { /* onPause() + unsubscribe sensor onChange */ },
})
```

`build()` creates every widget once. Most widgets **auto-update from system data** via their
`type: hmUI.data_type.*` binding — no JS needed for time, metric *numbers*, weather, battery, or
day-of-week. Two things are imperative; Vault Boy's walk is firmware-driven and needs neither:

| Driver | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `updateDate()` | Reads `Time.getDate()/getMonth()/getFullYear()`, zero-pads to `DDMMYYYY`, sets each of the 8 per-digit date `IMG`s' `SRC` (`0011`–`0020`). Per-digit (not `IMG_DATE`) keeps the digits pixel-aligned to the baked separator dots. |
| `updateGauges()` | For each of the 4 gauges (a data-driven `GAUGES` table), reads its sensor fraction, maps to a 0–5 level, and sets the gauge `IMG`'s `SRC` to that fill sprite. Runs on sensor `onChange` + the refresh timer. |

Vault Boy is a native `hmUI.widget.IMG_ANIM` (`anim_prefix: 'pipboy'`, frames `pipboy_0.png`–
`pipboy_7.png`, `anim_fps: 8`, looping) — the **firmware** cycles the frames and handles
visibility, so there's no JS timer, no `resume_call`/`pause_call` bookkeeping, and no
`getScreenType()` dependency for it at all (an earlier manual-timer version gated the walk on
`getScreenType() === SCREEN_TYPE_AOD`, which misreports AOD during normal rendering on this
device and froze the animation — see finding #13 in [ZEPPOS-FINDINGS.md](ZEPPOS-FINDINGS.md)).

**Lifecycle / battery.** The refresh timer (60 s, drives `updateDate`+`updateGauges`) is created
in `onResume()` and stopped in `onPause()` via a `WIDGET_DELEGATE` (`resume_call`/`pause_call`),
so it doesn't run while the face is hidden; `onResume()` is also called once at the end of
`build()` so the first paint doesn't wait on the first resume event (idempotent via a `_running`
guard). Risky sensor/router calls are wrapped in a small `safe()` helper.

Everything else (`IMG_TIME` hour/minute/second, the metric `TEXT_IMG`s, weather, battery,
`IMG_STATUS` icons) is declarative and bound by `data_type`/`system_status`. The four gauge bars
are plain `IMG`s driven by `updateGauges()` (see the widget table below and finding #2).

## Widget inventory

Coordinates are in the 480-px design space, straight from `watchface/index.js`.

| Element | Widget | `type` / binding | Asset(s) | x, y (w×h) |
|---------|--------|------------------|----------|------------|
| Background | `IMG` | — | `0000` | 0,0 (480×480) |
| Day of week | `IMG_LEVEL` | `WEEK` | `0026`–`0032` | 150,24 |
| Date digits (DD MM YYYY) | 8× `IMG` | sensor-driven | `0011`–`0020` | 82–179, 78 |
| Weather icon | `IMG_LEVEL` | `WEATHER_CURRENT` | `0079`–`0105` (27) | 330,78 |
| Temperature value | `TEXT_IMG` | `WEATHER_CURRENT` | `0011`–`0020`, neg `0021` | 338,78 (56×24), align RIGHT |
| Degree ° | `IMG` | — | `0023` | 394,78 |
| Vault Boy | `IMG_ANIM` (firmware-driven) | `anim_prefix:'pipboy'`, 8 fps | `pipboy_0`–`pipboy_7` | 186,130 |
| Time HH / MM / SS | `IMG_TIME` | autonomous | HH·MM `0001`–`0010`; SS `0011`–`0020` | 328,132 / 328,246 / 371,348 |
| Calories | `TEXT_IMG` | `CAL` | `0069`–`0078` | 17,149 (72×24), align RIGHT |
| Pulse | `TEXT_IMG` | `HEART` | `0069`–`0078` | 15,216 (58×24), align RIGHT |
| Distance | `TEXT_IMG` | `DISTANCE` | `0069`–`0078`, dot `0034` | 8,277 (80×24), align RIGHT |
| Steps | `TEXT_IMG` | `STEP` | `0069`–`0078` | 195,369 (96×24), align CENTER_H |
| Calories gauge | `IMG` (src-swapped) | Calorie sensor | `0200`–`0205` | 90,159 |
| Pulse gauge | `IMG` (src-swapped) | HeartRate sensor | `0206`–`0211` | 73,224 |
| Distance gauge | `IMG` (src-swapped) | Distance sensor | `0212`–`0217` | 90,286 |
| Steps gauge | `IMG` (src-swapped) | Step sensor | `0218`–`0223` | 194,349 |
| Battery value | `TEXT_IMG` | `BATTERY` | `0069`–`0078` | 74,379 (58×24), align RIGHT |
| Battery % | `IMG` | — | `0035` | 132,379 |
| Disconnect / Lock / Alarm | 3× `IMG_STATUS` | `DISCONNECT`/`LOCK`/`CLOCK` | `0054`/`0052`/`0055` | 312/351/405, ~367 |

The four metric gauges are plain **`IMG`** widgets whose `src` is swapped to the right 6-level
fill sprite in `updateGauges()` — the same proven `IMG` + `setProperty(hmUI.prop.SRC, …)` path the
date digits use, so the bar **always renders** (every sprite incl. level 0 has the green border —
never a black box). The level comes from `@zos/sensor` (the same data the numbers show): Cal & Steps
`current/getTarget()`, Distance `current/DIST_FULL_M` (~10 km full), Pulse linear over `[40,180]`;
`level = clamp(round(frac*5), 0, 5)`. Refreshed on each sensor's `onChange` + the 60 s timer.
Requires the `data:user.hd.{step,calorie,distance,heart_rate}` permissions in `app.json`.
(`IMG_LEVEL` was abandoned: `type:STEP` can't be shared by two gauges — left Distance/Steps as
black boxes — and a type-less `IMG_LEVEL` proved unreliable on-device.)

## Tap-to-launch shortcuts

Created **last in `build()`** (so they sit on top and capture touches), invisible. Most are
`BUTTON` widgets (hit area `w×h`, `transparent.png`) whose `click_func` calls `@zos/router`
`launchApp({ appId: SYSTEM_APP_*, native: true })` (try/catch). **Battery** is the exception: it
uses an `IMG_CLICK` with `type: hmUI.data_type.BATTERY` — a firmware "jumpable shortcut" that
auto-opens the battery page (there's no `SYSTEM_APP_BATTERY` and no documented battery page URL).

| Tap zone | x, y (w×h) | Mechanism | Opens |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Weather / temperature | 300,70 (135×44) | `launchApp` | `SYSTEM_APP_WEATHER` |
| Date | 78,72 (120×32) | `launchApp` | `SYSTEM_APP_CALENDAR` |
| Time — hours | 300,120 (160×113) | `launchApp` | `SYSTEM_APP_ALARM` |
| Time — minutes | 300,233 (160×107) | `launchApp` | `SYSTEM_APP_COUNTDOWN` (Timer) |
| Calories | 10,146 (155×32) | `launchApp` | `SYSTEM_APP_STATUS` (Activity) |
| Pulse | 10,210 (140×34) | `launchApp` | `SYSTEM_APP_HR` |
| Distance | 5,272 (160×34) | `launchApp` | `SYSTEM_APP_STATUS` |
| Steps | 185,345 (110×52) | `launchApp` | `SYSTEM_APP_STATUS` |
| Battery | 40,372 (120×34) | `IMG_CLICK` `type:BATTERY` | battery page |

`launchApp` targets a system app by name (`SYSTEM_APP_*`); for screens that have no such constant
(battery), an `IMG_CLICK` bound to a `data_type` is the firmware-routed way in (per the mrc206/
mrc209 reference faces).

## Preview

`node preview.js [out]` composites the face to a 480×480 image locally (round-clipped, with mock
data) so the layout can be checked **before flashing a watch**. Default output `preview.png`; an
output ending in `.gif` renders an **animated GIF** (the Vault Boy walk cycling `pipboy_0`–
`pipboy_7`; optional 2nd arg = frame count). It's a zero-dependency Node script (built-in `zlib`
only — no npm install): it **executes** `watchface/index.js` under mocked `@zos` modules to
capture the real `createWidget(...)` specs (`IMG_ANIM` frames are driven by the GIF frame index,
since the firmware — not a JS timer — cycles them on-device), and decodes/encodes the PNGs — and
the GIF (GIF89a + LZW) — itself. An approximation of firmware rendering — good for
position/presence, not a substitute for the device on data-driven fields. For a live preview,
`zeus preview` against the Zepp OS Simulator / a paired device.

## Origin

The layout/assets were originally produced by a GTR→Balance 2 converter (`convert_v2.py`, in the
separate `amazfit-gtr-zeppos-converter` repo) from the source GTR Pip-Boy 3000 face, then
hand-tuned over many on-device iterations, and finally **re-authored as modern `@zos` source**
so it builds with `zeus`. The converter is **not** required to build or modify this watch face —
the project here is self-contained ZeppOS source. The durable lessons live in
[ZEPPOS-FINDINGS.md](ZEPPOS-FINDINGS.md).
